# AI Trust Control Plane

## Overview
What problem this solves (AI trust & reliability)

## Architecture
High-level system flow (Datadog → Trust Engine → UI)

## Key Features
- Real-time trust score
- Incident-driven degradation
- RBAC & audit logs
- Datadog integration

## Datadog Integration
- Metrics sent
- Logs sent
- Incident simulation

## Demo Flow (IMPORTANT)
Step-by-step demo instructions:
1. Trigger failure
2. Trust drops
3. Datadog shows alert
4. Resolve incident
5. Trust recovers

## Production vs Simulation Boundary

- Simulation used for AI failures
- Real Datadog ingestion
- Deterministic trust logic

## Setup Instructions
Exact steps to run locally
